##This update will mark the plugin officially being branded as released. It has been around now for a while without any need for update as it has never broken.##

#Feature Proposal#
-Add additional message options for when alert is given normally
-Add additional option to instead of killing or exploding the cow it sends a message from an alt message pool
-Add option to deal damage to the player that touched the cow with variable strength, debating random number or variable based on damage dealt to the cow
-Add option to rather than explode or kill the cow it spawns a variable number of cows and uses an alt message pool

##ETA##

Best ETA I can offer is: Late April to the middle of May.
