# cowSPLOSION
### Bukkit / Spigot / Minecraft / Server Plugin

cowSPLOSION allows the server owner to decide if cows should explode when attacked by a player or arrow and how big the explosion should be.


This plugin is simplistic now but it will gradually have more features and effect more mobs.

 
#### cowSPLOSION v0.0.1.0 works with:
1.7.2 / 1.8 / 1.9 / 1.10 / 1.11
(May work with other versions but these have been tested)

#### cowSPLOSION v1.0.0.0rxx-SNAPSHOT Not Always Tested.
Use Builds on Jenkins with that in mind. 
Jenkins is currently only open to some, that will change with time.
    
#### Features:

Configuration file to allow the server owner to alter what is said to players and explosion strength.

Players will cause a cow to explode and die by attacking.
